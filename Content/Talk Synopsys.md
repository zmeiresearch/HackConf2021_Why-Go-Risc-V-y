# Talk Description
You've interacted with several hundreds or thousands processors today already - from the tiny ones controlling the coffee machines and the traffic lights, through the workhorses that our mobile phones have become, to the huge behemoths that hyperscalers use in their datacenters to provide cloud services. Processors come in completely different forms, packages and capabilities, but share one thing in common - they are closed designs that some company develops and another one uses to achieve a goal.

RISC-V changes this.

RISC-V is a processor ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) that is open and free to use. Best of all, there is already a healthy ecosystem around it. But why should you bother and not just go with a proven solution from an established supplier? Flexibility, security and future proofing. - Flexibility to easily tailor the solution to the problem, reaching performance/power consumption points impossible for a generic solution. Think Bitcoin-mining ASICs vs a GPU. - Security to go down to gate-level, analyze exactly what is happening and fix the issue rather than work-around it. Think Heartbleed and IME. - Future-proofing to start small with an entry-level FPGA, scale up and down as needed or go full-out with an ASIC if there is commercial sense.

Plus, there is no better way to understand a system than to build it yourself from the grounds up. And get a lot of fun in the process!
